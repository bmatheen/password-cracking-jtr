Beginner demo: generating md5crypt hashes with OpenSSL and cracking with John the Ripper in Kali Linux (education only).

# Password Cracking with John the Ripper (Beginner Demo)

This project demonstrates how weak passwords can be cracked from **md5crypt** hashes using **John the Ripper** on **Kali Linux**.  
**For education only. Do not use on systems/data you donâ€™t own or have explicit permission to test.**

## Project Goals
- Generate a password hash with `openssl`
- Crack it with `john`
- Show why strong passwords and modern KDFs (bcrypt/scrypt/Argon2) matter
